# Projects
Things I want to create or change in myself or the world around me. This includes things that can be coded, habits to form, ideas to better understand, topics to learn, etc.

## Personal Projects
- Meditation. Let's give it a real (daily) shot and see what comes of it.

## Technical Projects
- Tweetocracy
- Some sort of 'live' news feed accompanying a twitter feed. Perhaps use Watson to pull content out of tweets and then use news API to show related stories.

## Things to learn (inc. courses)
- Sam Altman's [how to start a startup](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/)
