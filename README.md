## Week of March 20th, 2017

## Reflection
Wow, I really didn't do so well with this week's goals. I did get all my stuff fron NYC to Boston, which was no minor feat. And I did significantly underestimate how much time early in the week I needed to spend packing to accomplish this.

**On not completing things:**

I really struggle to find the balance between planning to do more than I can possibly accomplish with the intent of getting as much as possible done, and trying to accurately plan for how much I can do and consistently accomplishing everything I want. In some respects, the former is overwhelming and the latter underwhelming.

At this point, I don't think it would be appropriate to take the latter approach at work. But on the personal front - where I have some flexibility - I'd like to approach the latter. Next week will be the first week I accomplish all of my goals. And I realize that a part of that is having fewer. I think 3 is a great place to start.

(P.S. - I realize that I've been thinking of the balance described above quite a bit. In fact, I've even found myself delving into the topics in happy hour conversation with friends. Perhaps it's time I write a companion to my blog post on [working and playing hard](https://tldlife.com/all-or-nothing-a-case-for-wasting-time-5a8e7c76fb51#.9jok6t6gl).)

## The wins
This is going to be a new section - something I just want to make sure I keep for next week :)

## Notes on the week
- I'm a fan of Dave Rubin's point that we (esp liberals) are censoring and silencing ourselves better than the government ever could. People are much more guarded in their opinions and increasingly fail to express original views.
- There seems to be potential for synchronized growth in the world. At the end of 2015, there was a lot of anxiety about China slumping. Now developing nations are growing along with the U.S. and - finally - the EU.
	- South Korea's economy is a great proxy for int'l trade
	- U.S. inflation hitting 2% target. Labor markets are tight in developed nations.
- An interesting measure of quality of life is access to diverse food. Lots of people are starting to have access to new foods - particularly grains (*cough* quinoa *cough*).
- TL;DR on China and Taiwan. Taiwan started as the losers of civil war to Mao. Clearly lots of debate over whether or not Taiwan is part of China. U.S. was just like "yeah we think China + Taiwan = 1 country but we aren't going to say whose or anything useful like that. Oh also we're going to sell arms to Taiwan." Trump has threatened and (more recently) confirmed U.S. policy. 
- 25% of murders in Chicago lead to arrest. (about 2/3 nationwide)
- Temer in Brazil is rocking needed reforms to pensions and other social spending that would wreck the country if unchecked. He doesn't care about re-election and has a gov that supports him.
- Trinidad is 1/3 Indian on account of indentured servants
- FATA is automous region in Pakistan where terrorists are. They have abysmal literacy rates. But Pakistan as a whole is doing pretty well; stock market won 1st place in last year's Asian stock market growth contest. They even only cut power 6 hours a day now.
- [Gravitational Waves](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/gravitational-wave-kicks-monster-black-hole-out-of-galactic-core) literally moved a black hole. There are a lot of big numbers in here, but basically some grav waves from two black holes colliding. We can tell black hole moved because it is marked by Quasar (black holes are energy source for quasars). Black hole travelled more than the distance between our sun and center of Milky Way. So the thing was moving pretty damn fast.
- Ryancare failed :) The GOP seems to be generally destroying itself over it. Also shoutout the freedom caucus for the first time ever.
