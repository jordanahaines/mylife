## Week of March 20th, 2017
### Day by Day

### Things I Learned

### Ideas and Musings
- I'm a fan of Dave Rubin's point that we (esp liberals) are censoring and silencing ourselves better than the government ever could. People are much more guarded in their opinions and increasingly fail to express original views.
- There seems to be potential for synchronized growth in the world. At the end of 2015, there was a lot of anxiety about China slumping. Now developing nations are growing along with the U.S. and - finally - the EU.
	- South Korea's economy is a great proxy for int'l trade
	- U.S. inflation hitting 2% target. Labor markets are tight in developed nations.
- An interesting measure of quality of life is access to diverse food. Lots of people are starting to have access to new foods - particularly grains (*cough* quinoa *cough*).
- TL;DR on China and Taiwan. Taiwan started as the losers of civil war to Mao. Clearly lots of debate over whether or not Taiwan is part of China. U.S. was just like "yeah we think China + Taiwan = 1 country but we aren't going to say whose or anything useful like that. Oh also we're going to sell arms to Taiwan." Trump has threatened and (more recently) confirmed U.S. policy. 
- 25% of murders in Chicago lead to arrest. (about 2/3 nationwide)
- Temer in Brazil is rocking needed reforms to pensions and other social spending that would wreck the country if unchecked. He doesn't care about re-election and has a gov that supports him.
- Trinidad is 1/3 Indian on account of indentured servants
- FATA is automous region in Pakistan where terrorists are. They have abysmal literacy rates. But Pakistan as a whole is doing pretty well; stock market won 1st place in last year's Asian stock market growth contest. They even only cut power 6 hours a day now.
